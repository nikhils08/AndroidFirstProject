# Bluetooth On when screen is locked

This app deals with the bluetooth when the screen is turned off and is really helpfull with using MI Band as many people forget to switch bluetooth. So this will help them by turning it on automatically.
The App switches the bluetooth Off when the device is being used for more than 5 mins as the band connection is not needed when using device for much time.
